                <h4>DIVINE PRINCE DANIEL (DIVCIPRINCE) SURGE AGENDA MANIFESTO.</h4>
                <p>Greatest Nigerian Students, With the idea of Malice to None, concentrated passion to all, in built with high level of political sagacity, Academic ingenuity and social dexterity.</p>
                <p>Wise men often say, speeches without introduction is nothing but an obnoxious calamity. For me to avoid this obnoxious calamity I’ll start by my humble nomenclature, which goes as Divine Prince Daniel a 400l student of computer science department.</p>
                <p>Over the years, I’ve served the union in different capacities, ranging from being one of the best executives under the Professorcoded led administration as the PRO and being a legislator in the hallowed chamber of the students union assembly, to being a candidate for the prestigious students union president in the coming election.</p>
                <p> Dare to struggle, Dareto win.It is being said, "whatever is worth doing is worth doing well", and it is on this note that I have to publicly declare and express my manifesto of action towards the course of my aspiration, which is solely born out of my zeal and potential to serve all Futmites .I’m ready to serve YOU with my SURGE AGENDA- A plan that puts Futmites first in every aspect.Curiousity might make you ask, what is surge Agenda. It’s an acronym for students welfare, United campus experience, Revamped Academic resources , Growth and sustainability and Engagement and Advocacy.</p>
                <p>But I often love to refer to it as STUDENT UNION REFORM, GROWTH AND EMPOWERMENT.</p>
                <p> <strong>1. STUDENT WELFARE FIRST:-</strong> Improved Healthcare: I’ll ensure our university clinics in Bosso and GK are well-equipped with the latest medical supplies and resources. I have held a menstrual hygiene and also a proposed a sickle cell awareness program earlier in the past to address some health issues and I won't stop. I am also currently working with NGOs to provide 5,000 mosquito nets to prevent the most common illness we face, which is malaria. Also to establish a red cross team on campus to enlighten students regularly on first aid measures especially for cases of drowning, convulsion and seizures and also provide first aid kits across all faculties.</p>
                <p>I'm already working towards the establishment of a permanent mental health sector in the university where students facing mental and emotional challenges, academic stress and downtime can run to for mental health checks.</p>
                <p>- Provision of BETTER Network Services: I’ll work with Glo, MTN, and other providers especially airtel which I currently have reach to, towards improving network coverage and there will be no difference between starlink and our regular networks.</p>
                <p>- Toilets availability: I’ll make sure our hostel and faculty toilets are regularly cleaned and properly maintained. The other public toilets along post office, roadways and outside the faculties shall all be opened for use henceforth.</p>
                <p>- Hostel Generators: there will be a mandatory fuel budget from the pocket of the students union to put it on for hostelites anytime there might be blackout and compulsory from 8-12pm every night.</p>
                <p>- Collaborative transport system: When I served as PRO, we were able to mobilize numbers of NSTA buses to aid in decongesting the rate of queueing to get buses and I will continue from there by bringing back this long buses Initiative and tackling other challenges through the ticketing system.</p>
                <p><strong>2. UNITED CAMPUS EXPERIENCE:</strong> There will be Creation of Students Union Village, modern SUG Sectetariat and social centre, which will include and facilitate recreational facilities,elite social activities and entertainment for our students. I have an NGO willing to give free 10,000 thousand blocks if we can get a land from the school and it will be done. The various sport clubs as well will be supported with a regulatory body to help and aid the development of sporting activities on our campus.</p>
                <p> <strong>3. Revamped Academic resources:</strong> My advocacy will include the upgrades in our laboratories, Continual and strong WiFi in hostels and major classrooms for students learning. We will also bring back the Student Union E-Book resources and past question site for our students to access from across all class reps which we once had.</p>
                <p><strong>4. Growth and capital development:</strong> Students Empowerment schemes shall be initiated through the school entrepreneurship center, students that were not captured during the last time shall be given the grace to do so through collaboration with NELFUND. During my time as PRO, I mobilized free adverts for various students entrepreneurs to boost their business and I am ready to go further.</p>
                <p><strong>5. Engagement and Advocacy:</strong> Your voice matters, and I’m here to ensure it’s heard by ensuring Active Representation and taking our concerns directly to the university management with constant communication. Establishment of additional constituencies; as the population of students increases and students now live in areas like Gidan Mangoro, Kpakungu, Tunga, Maikunkele We need representatives for those areas, and not just 3 off campus SRAs</p>
                <p>On this junction J, operation O, Time T, I'll like to say Aluta Continua, Victoria Ascerta.</p>
